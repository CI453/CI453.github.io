	<h3> What is Mitigation Privacy Threats? </h3>

	<p>This is the process used to lessen the impact of a problem or an attack, this is done by isolating or containing a threat so then the issue can be solved.</p>

	
	<h3> Ways Of Minimising Privacy Threats </h3>
	
	<p> There are many ways of minimising privacy threats, a lot of these methods are security controls, they are very efficient and reliable to use, these security controls can be ones such as:</p>
		
	<ul> 
		<li>Authentication</li>
		<li>Firewalls</li>
		<li>Antivirus software</li>
		<li>Intrusion dettection systems</li>
		
	</ul>
	
	<h3> Authentication </h3>
	
	<p>Authentication is establishing the validity of something, this can be a identity or someone. Authentication is used to keep networks safe and secure by only giving access to permitted users that are authorised. This is used in organisations so that only certain users have access also making sure that confidential information cannot be accessed by users who are not authorised. </p>
	
	<h3> Firewall </h3>
	
	<p>A firewall is a system that prevents unauthorised access to a network. All traffic passes through the firewall whether it passes in or out of the system, but only authorised traffic can be allowed to pass. </p>
	
	<h3> Antivirus Software </h3>
	
	<p>An antivirus software is used to detect, prevent and remove any viruses/malware. This can prevent any malicious activity from happening keeping organisations and users data private and safe.</p>
	
	<h3> Intrusion Detection Dystem </h3>
	
	<p>An IDS (Intrusion detection system) is a system that monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and give alerts when there is activity found. This is a software application that scans a network or system for policy breaching or harmful activity. </p>
	
	<h3> How Are These Security Controls Used To Minimise Risk </h3>
	
	<p>Security controls are used in many businesses and organisations or any type of user to protect them from risks such as, attackers (hackers). Above there is a list of types of Security controls that can be used effectively to minimise privacy threats. Another way to make privacy more secure is by regularly updating your password and enlightening users and in organisations cases their employees on types of attacks such as:</p>

	<ul>
		<li> Phishing Attacks </li>
		<li> Dictionary Attacks </li>
		<li> Man In The Middle Attacks </li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3> Phishing Attacks </h3>
	
	<p>Phishing is a type of social engineering method which could be a fake email pretending to be someone else like a bank, member of an organisation or even family for example. The aim is to gain personal information by tricking users. A way that this can be prevented is by educating users on these types of attacks and how they are performed. Doing this can therefore lead to less phishing attacks and make users understand when these attacks are being performed.</p>
	
	<h3> Dictionary Attacks </h3>
	
	<p>Dictionary attacks are where there is a dictionary of passwords that are common and by using Brute Force on many accounts means that some accounts can be accessed meaning private information can be exploited. Ways that this can be prevented is by making sure that passwords are changed frequently, while users do not use weak passwords which means that by making them contain the following will make them strong:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li> Special characters </li>
		<li> Numbers </li>
		<li> Lower and Upper Case </li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>In a study by Andy P (EUD Security Research Lead) published in 2018, that 75% of users in an organisations had accounts with passwords that featured in the top 1,000 and 87% in the top 10,000. Therefore, its so important to have strong passwords and have them changed often. </p>
	
	<h3> Man In The Middle Attacks </h3>
	
	<p>Man in the middle is a type attack where someone or something puts themselves into a communication session between people or systems maliciously so that they can gather private information. Ways that this can be detected or prevented is by using appropriate authentication and IDS which will detect an intruder alerting the hosts. </p>
