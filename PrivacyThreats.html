	<h3> What is Mitigation Privacy Threats? </h3>

	<p>This is the process used to lessen the impact of a problem or an attack, this is done by isolating or containing a threat so then the issue can be solved</p>

	
	<h3> Ways Of Minimising Privacy Threats </h3>
	
	<p> There are many ways of minimising privacy threats, a lot of these methods are security controls, they are very efficient and reliable to use, these security controls can be ones such as:</p>
		
	<ul> 
		<li>Authentication</li>
		<li>Firewalls</li>
		<li>Antivirus software</li>
		<li>Intrusion dettection systems</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3> Authentication </h3>
	
	<p>Authentication is establishing the validity of something, this can be a identity or someone. Authentication is used to keep networks safe and secure by only giving access to permitted users that are authorised. This is used in organisations so that only certain users have access also making sure that confidential information cannot be accessed by users who are not authorised. </p>
	
	<h3> Firewall </h3>
	
	<p>A firewall is a system that prevents unauthorised access to a network. All traffic passes through the firewall whether it passes in or out of the system, but only authorised traffic can be allowed to pass. </p>
	
	<h3> Antivirus software </h3>
	
	<p>An antivirus software is used to detect, prevent and remove any viruses/malware. This can prevent any malicious activity from happening keeping organisations and users data private and safe.</p>
	
	<h3> Intrusion detection system </h3>
	
	<p>An IDS (Intrusion detection system) is a system that monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and give alerts when there is activity found. This is a software application that scans a network or system for policy breaching or harmful activity. </p>
