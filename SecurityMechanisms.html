			<h3> security mechanisms through confidentiality</h3>
				
			</header>
			
			
<article>  
<p>confidentiality is a vital part of any security system. protecting sensitive information from unwanted, irresponsible or malicious disclosure by effectively limiting the number of people or systems that 
can access that data, as well as the sections that they can access and under what circumstances they can access it. Cryptography is the single greatest method of ensuring the confidentiality of data however 
multiple other systems exist to protect the privacy of your data, such as authentication systems.  </p>

<p>Legally, any personal data that an organisation keeps must be kept confidential under the general data 
protection regulation and organisations are required to review their physical storage methods and  the 
staff that have access as well as destroying irrelevant data that they cannot justifiably retain.

			<h3> Security mechanisms through authentification and data integrity   </h3>
				
			</header>

<article>
    
    <p> authentication is the process of ensuring security through ensuring that anyone or anything attempting to access a system is who they claim to be. this is absolutely vital to any cyber security system
	and forms the basis of the vast majority of the security that most users and systems will use day to day. this can be as complex as establishing a two factor authentication system which massively bolsters personal data security, 
	or as simple as using end to end encryption, something that almost every system can do nowadays without the user being consciously aware of it. It also covers non-repudiation systems, which are vital in ensuring the origin of data
	and protecting against man in the middle or phishing attacks.
</p>
	
	<p></p>
    
	<p>A major part of cyber security is data integrity, this is the need to ensure data is not lost, damaged or corrupted. all of these can occur through accidental errors, or due to deliberate attack. 
data integrity services aim to ensure the protection of data from deliberate attack, as data is one of the most valuable assets that an individual or organisation can possess. as there is no real way to 
fully restore data that has been lost, data integrity services aim to simply detect hostile alterations to data, thereby alerting the user to the threat . this ties into authentication as protecting data 
is one of the primary purposes of an authentication system.
