			<h3> security mechanisms through confidentiality</h3>
				
			</header>
			
			
<article>  
	<h4> confidentialityâ€™s significance</h4>
	<p>confidentiality is a vital part of any security system. protecting sensitive information from unwanted, irresponsible, or malicious disclosure by effectively
	limiting the number of people or systems that can access that data, as well as the sections that they can access and under what circumstances they can access it.
	Cryptography is the single greatest method of ensuring the confidentiality of data however multiple other systems exist to protect the privacy of your data, such
	as authentication systems. </p>
	<h4>legal requirements</h4>
	<p>under UK and EU law any personal data that an organisation keeps must be kept confidential under the general data protection regulation act, and organisations
	are required to review their physical storage methods and the staff that have access as well as destroying irrelevant data that they cannot justifiably retain. 
	This was established to reinforce existing protection laws that existed under the data protection directive as well as to fulfil newer "right to privacy" goals
	that the European parliament has set forward. Confidentiality is the primary goal of any security system and as such the legal ramifications for breaching these
	security mechanisms is severe, with companies that breach the new legislation facing a fine of potentially up to 5% of global revenue.

	<h3> Security mechanisms through cryptography</h3>
			
</header>


<article>
	<h4>what is cryptography</h4> 
    <p>Cryptography is the single most important mechanism for data protection, it is necessary for any and all communications between systems and is also often used internally
	by a single system to further ensure the protection of data. cryptography is the process of securing data by using a cipher to convert plain text into unreadable cipher text,
	this prevents external parties to gain access to secure information as it is transmitted. The cryptographic process occurs in three stages:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The plaintext is converted to ciphertext by the sender</li>
		<li>The ciphertext is transmitted from the sender to the receiver </li>
		<li>The ciphertext is converted back to plain text by the receiver</li>
	</ol>
	<p>This simple process allows for any data to be sent in the knowledge that it will always be securely transmitted and ensures that you are able to easily access data that you are intended to receive.</p>

			<h3> Security mechanisms through authentication  and data integrity   </h3>
				
			</header>

<article>
    <h4>authentication</h4>
    <p> authentication is the process of ensuring security through ensuring that anyone or anything attempting to access a system is who they claim to be. this is absolutely vital to any cyber security system
	and forms the basis of the vast majority of the security that most users and systems will use day to day. this can be as complex as establishing a two factor authentication system which massively bolsters personal data security, 
	or as simple as using end to end encryption, something that almost every system can do nowadays without the user being consciously aware of it. It also covers non-repudiation systems, which are vital in ensuring the origin of data
	and protecting against man in the middle or phishing attacks.
</p>
	
	<h4> data integrity</h4>
	<p>A major part of cyber security is data integrity, this is the need to ensure data is not lost, damaged or corrupted. all of these can occur through accidental errors, or due to deliberate attack. 
data integrity services aim to ensure the protection of data from deliberate attack, as data is one of the most valuable assets that an individual or organisation can possess. as there is no real way to 
fully restore data that has been lost, data integrity services aim to simply detect hostile alterations to data, thereby alerting the user to the threat . this ties into authentication as protecting data 
is one of the primary purposes of an authentication system.
