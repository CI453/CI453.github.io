	<h3> What is Information Privacy? </h3>
	<p> More commonly known as data protection, information privacy is the gathering, compilation, and selective dissemination
	of information. However it is important to know!.. </p>
	
	<h4> Privacy != Security </h4>
	<p>
		These two are often confused. Computer Security, otherwise known as IT security or cyber security focuses on protecting
		the system itself from theft or damage. This could be to any part of the computer, like the hardware or software, as well
		as the information stored on them. More information about the types of attacks can be found on the <a href="PrivacyThreats.html"> Privacy Threats</a> page.
		stored.
	</p>
	<h4> Privacy != Secrecy </h4>
	<p>
		Secrecy is hiding information to protect oneself or gain an advantage over someone/thing.
		While privacy is consensual, secrecy is not. We are given a right to privacy but not a right
		to secrecy.
	</p>
	
	<h4>	The privacy of an individual depends on these five main things	</h4>
	
	<dl>
		<dt>Information receiver</dt>
		<dd>- Who the information is being shared with</dd>
		<dt>Information Usage</dt>
		<dd>- What the receiver will use the information for</dd>
		<dt>Personal sensitivities</dt>
		<dd>- What one person might see as private information, another may see as intrusive</dd>
		<dt>Time</dt>
		<dd>- The information that the individual shares and deems private may change with time</dd>
		<dt>Data footprint</dt>
		<dd>- Personal information that is uploaded willingly online by oneself, by others, as attached data, or online records</dd>
	</dl>

	<h3> Privacy risks and protection </h3>
		<p> Here are just a few privacy risks an individual could be exposed to</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Statistical regression</li>
				<li>Auto-complete data becomes compromised</li>
				<li>Phishing attacks</li>
				<li>Disgruntled relation giving away your information</li>
				<li>XXS or SWL injection</li>
				<li>Man in the middle attacks</li>
				<li>Unauthorized device access</li>
				<li>Identity theft</li> 
			</ul>
	
	<p> These are all scary things but they can be avoided by <b>Privacy Protection</b> which luckily for the average person
		isn't to hard to achieve as laws are in place to keep us safe. There is also code of conducts business and organisations 
		must follow to be deemed trust-worthy, with no privacy protection in place they will have no users.</p>
		<h4> Privacy Impact Assessment </h4>
			<p> A Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) is the evaluation of privacy risks that could potentially affect the organisation. 
			They must be independent from the organisation itself, and performed by an independent entity. It is important to consider privacy right from the start.
			Having a privacy-based approach reduces the chance and effectiveness of threats that might occur. If a organisation fails to carry out a PIA the 
			Information Commissioner Office can impose enforcement action, this could cause a fine upwards to 2% of an organisations annual turnover.
	
			</p>
			
		<h4> Privacy by Design </h4>
		<p> <b>The seven principles of Privacy by Design</b></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Proactive not reactive</li>
				<li>Privacy as the default setting</li>
				<li>Privacy embedded into design</li>
				<li>Full functionality</li>
				<li>End-to-end security</li>
				<li>Visibility and transparency</li>
				<li>Respect for users privacy</li>
			</ol>
	<p>
		"Privacy by Design and by default" is where privacy is one of the main focal points throughout the whole engineering process.
		The General Data Protection Regulation requires that organisations take the appropriate measures to implement the listed
		principles. With recent changes to GDPR, Privacy by Design went from a guideline to a legal requirement.
